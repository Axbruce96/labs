    <h4>Son Goku&#39;s Childhood</h4>
    <hr class="hr2" />
        <p>
        <img src="Images/DB Kid Goku 2.jpg" alt="Kid Goku" class="imgright" />
        Son Goku lived a quiet life on Mount Paozu, alone as a monkey-tailed child after the mysterious death of his adoptive Grandpa Gohan. One day while completing his daily chores Son Goku ran into a human traveler named Bulma, a teenage girl with blue hair. </p>
<p>Upon returning to his house Goku finds his Dragon Ball, given to him by Grandpa Gohan, humming and glowing. Bulma then explained that this was because she had three others just like it and if they were to gather all seven Dragon Balls then they can summon the Eternal Dragon, Shenron and have any wish granted.<img src="Images/DB Kid Goku 3.jpg" alt="Kid Goku and Bulma" class="imgleft" /> Hearing this Goku decided to team up with Bulma and get the rest of the Dragon Balls together. Shortly after setting out they encountered a lost sea turtle who Goku decided to help find the sea. 
        <br />
        <br />
        Once they had reached the sea the turtle revealed it is friends with a hermit named Master Roshi, who after hearing the news about safe return of his friend and gave Goku the Flying Nimbus, a magical cloud that only allows those pure-of-heart to ride it.<img src="Images/DB Master Roshi.jpg" alt="Master Roshi" class="imgright" /> Then the Dragon Radar, a device Bulma invented to track Dragon Balls, lead them to Aru village which was under attack from a shape-shifter who was stealing the villagers daughters. In exchange for the villages&#39; Dragon Ball, Goku agreed to be bait for the shape-shifter in order to find out where it was taking the girls. After the plan failed Goku was forced to defeat the shape-shifter, who was originally a pig named Oolong, in combat and free the daughters of the village. Bulma forced Oolong to join the group and they continued onward to the next Dragon Ball located at Fire Mountain, the home of the Ox-King.
        <br />
        <br />
        Immediately upon their arrival Goku attempted to race to the top with the Flying Nimbus but was stopped due to the intense heat. While attempting to return to Bulma, Goku was attacked by the Ox-King who only stopped his assault when he saw the nimbus cloud. The Ox-King shares that Master Roshi was his and Grandpa Gohan&#39;s old martial arts teacher, so he instructed Goku to go with his daughter Chi-Chi and to get the Bansho Fan from Roshi. When they arrived Roshi told them that he had gotten rid of the fan years ago but then agreed to go put out the fire himself. Back at Fire Mountain, Master Roshi unveils a powerful Technique called the Kahmehameha Wave which proves to be too strong and destroys the mountain altogether.<img src="Images/DB Fire Mountain.jpg" alt="Kahmehameha" class="imgleft" /> Under the rubble Bulma found the 6th Dragon ball and the Ox-King, thankful for them putting out the fire, gave Goku and Bulma his car.
        <br />
        <br />
        It turns out that they are not the only ones searching for the dragon balls, a small blue man named Emporer Pilaf who has the 7th dragon ball. Pilaf aided by his assistants, a dog-man named Shu and a beautiful foot-soldier named Mai, trapped Goku and Bulma in a room with sleeping gas. He then summoned the Eternal Dragon but before he could make his wish Oolong interrupted with a wish for women&#39;s panties. The Dragon Balls then shot away unable to be used again for a whole year. Enraged Pilaf imprisoned Oolong with Bulma and Goku.<img src="Images/DB Great Ape 1.jpg" alt="Great Ape" class="imgright" /> While in prison Goku revealed that a giant beast crushed Grandpa Gohan&#39;s shack killing him and it was on the night of the full moon. Upon finishing his shtory Goku saw the full moon through his cell and began to transform into a great and enraged ape. Pilaf and his minions barely escaped the castle and left bulma and the group inside who cut off Goku&#39;s tail returning him to normal. He awakes in the morning with no memory of the incident. Everyone decided to part ways, Bulma returned to her home in West City and gave Goku the Dragon Radar to find hid grandpa&#39;s Dragon Ball, Goku went to train and get stronger with Master Roshi.

       <p>
       After a World Martial Arts Tournament, Goku and the gang were out celebrating with dinner when Goku went back to the stadium for his four star Dragon Ball and power pole. Upon arriving at the stadium Goku finds his friend Krilin dead with the announcer by hisside. The announcer tells Goku that a mysterious monster killed Krilin, took the Dragon Ball, and flew off.
       <img src="Images/DB Krilin.jpg" alt="Goku Finds Krilin" class="imgright" />
       Overcome with grief Goku took the Dragon Radar from Bulma and went after the monster despite Master Roshi ordering him to stop. After Goku had left Oolong found a piece of paper with a strange symbol on it. Horrified, Roshi explains that it is that of the evil King Piccolo.
       <br />
       <br />
       Roshi then told of a time long ago when strong monsters rampaged the world destroying everything in their path. The leader and strongest of these monsters was King Piccolo. Eventually these monsters made their way to Mutaito&#39;s dojo where Roshi currently lived. The students fought the monsters until only two survived, Master Roshi and Master Shen. Then King Piccolo arrived and Master Mutaito had to step in but was easily defeated and the three of them were forced to flee. After several years of training Mutaito was able to capture King Piccolo using a technique called the Evil Containment Wave to trap him in a jar. Master Roshi then threw the jar into the ocean and founded the Turtle School based on Mutaito&#39;s teachings. Over time the world forgot about King Piccolo.
       <br />
       <br />
       King Piccolo was released when Emperor Pilaf found his jar and opened it in hopes of gaining his help in gathering the Dragon Balls. King Piccolo had other plans though and had his henchmen go and kill every participant in the World Martial Arts Tournament as they could be threats. Goku finally tracked down Piccolo&#39;s henchman but was still too exhausted from the tournament and was easily beaten. When he awoke Goku then went in search of food and found Yajirobe, another strong fighter who happened to be in possession of a Dragon Ball. This causes another of Piccolo&#39;s  henchmen to attack Yajirobe who kills and eats it, furious King Piccolo sends his another to avenge the first. This time Goku is back at full strength and defeats the henchman easily. King Piccolo then goes himself to fight Goku and easily knocks him out, leavingin after presuming him dead. Yajirobe then nursed Goku back to health.
       <br />
       <br />
       Piccolo was then able to gather six of the Dragon Balls and was lured into a trap by master Roshi with the seventh. Piccolo began to assault Roshi who just stood still taking his attacks. Roshi then attempted the Evil Containment Wave but missed the opening of his rice cooker at the last second. In his final breaths Roshi told Piccolo that this isn&#39;t over and there is another who will succeed. With no one left to stop him Piccolo is then able to make his wish for youth, boosting his power substantially. With his new found power he destroys Shenron and the Dragon Balls so none of his victims can be revived. King Piccolo then takes over the earth and betrays Pilaf.

Once there Korin told them about the Ultra Divine Water which will make him stronger so Yajirobe and Goku traveled to obtain it. After overcoming some monsters they finally reach the water and are told that it may kill Goku. After drinking the water Goku collapsed in pain for several hours. After overcoming the pain he them awoke stronger than King Piccolo. Goku immediately left to confront him. A massive battle ensues with the tide constantly changing in favor of Goku or Piccolo. Eventually Goku launches himself at an exhaused King Piccolo, blowing a hole straight through his chest, killin him.
