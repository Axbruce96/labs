        The Z-fighters had once again settled into their peaceful lives after the threat of Majin Buu when unbeknownst to them on the other side of the universe the God of Destruction Beerus had just awoken from his long slumber. Beerus had had dreams in his sleep of an emensley power being called a Super Saiyan God and was determined to meet it and test their strength. Looking through his staff the closest his angel assistant Whis could find is a Super Saiyan named Goku on Earth. Beerus rushed to Earth for answers. On his arrival Vegeta is the only one aware of who Beerus is as they had met last time Beerus had awoke and visited his home planet. Beerus became irritated with no information on the Super Saiyan God threatened to destroy the Earth. Goku and the others decided to summon Shenron for answers.

        Shenron explains that on the planet Vegeta long ago he Saiyans faced the threat of extinction from an invading force, with no where else to turn five Saiyans combined their strength into one in order to create a Super Saiyan God and destroy the threat. With five Saiyans currently on Earth they decide to make Goku a Super Saiyan God to appease Beerus. The ritual worked and Goku became a Saiyan God and sparred with Beerus. Their fight began to shake the universe apart and feeling satisfied with Goku&#39;s new found power, Beerus decided to end it explaining that while Goku had given him a challenge it still wasn&#39;t enough. He only decided to spare the Earth for more delicious food in the future.

        While Goku and Vegeta were training on Beerus&#39;s planet he received a visit from his counterpart, the God of Destruction from Universe 6 Champa. They explained to Goku and Vegeta that their are twelve universes in total, their universe is Universe 7 and is the parallel to Universe 6. Champa was in Universe 7 in search of the Super Dragon Balls, giant Dragon Balls the size of planets able to grant wishes beyond that of Shenron on Earth. Beerus and Champa are at odds abut who gets the Dragon Balls so they decide to host a Tournament between the two universes. Goku and Vegeta gather strong fighters from Earth to participate. After a month of preparation the tournament begins. As each battle concluded it seemed close as to who would take the Dragon Balls.
        <img src="Images/DBS Goku.jpg" alt="Goku vs. Hit" class="imgright" />
         It came down to Goku against Universe 6&#39;s most feared assassin Hit, the battle was close due to Hits ability to stop time. Hit decided to let Goku win as he disliked Champa and Beerus&#39;s fighting. It turns out that the supreme ruler of all twelve universes, Zeno, had witnessed their tournament and enjoyed it so much that he decided to host one between all twelve universes in a years time.
