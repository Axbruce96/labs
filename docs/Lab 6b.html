        <img src="Images/DBZ Goku 1.jpg" alt="Goku and Gohan" class="imgleft" />
        Since saving the world and defeating the evil King Piccolo, Goku has been leading a peaceful life. He married Chichi, the daughter of the Ox King, and they had a son named Gohan after Goku&#39;s adoptive grandfather. Everything was perfect for Goku until an alien ship landed on the planet one day. The ship carried one being, a Saiyan named Radditz who went straight for Goku upon arriving on Earth. At this time Goku was visiting Kame house, the home of Master Roshi, along with Bulma, Krilin, and his son Gohan. When Raditz arrived he explained that Goku was his brother and also a Saiyan, Goku was sent to Earth as a child in order to grow stronger and destroy humanity in order to sell the planet. Hearing this Goku rejected Raditz so he kidnapped Gohan in hopes of turning Goku. Sensing Raditz strong power Piccolo Jr. set out to find its source and found himself at Kame House with Goku. Because Piccolo wanted humanity alive in order to rule over them he decided to fight with Goku. Together Goku and Piccolo went after Raditz but were still no match for for him.

         In order to defeat him Goku had to hold Raditz hy the tail and have Piccolo use his Special Beam Cannon which killed Raditz at the expense of Goku as well. In his dying breaths Raditz told Piccolo that two other Saiyans, both stronger than him, are coming in one year to find the dragon balls and wipe out the human race. Piccolo decided to take Gohan in order to train him and be ready for the Saiyans. Goku found himself in Other World, the realm of the dead, and because of Goku&#39;s good deeds he was allowed to keep his body and take the chance to cross Snake Way and train with the great martial artist King Kai.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;After one year of training both Goku and his son Gohan have gotten significantly stronger. Bulma and the others have gathered the Dragon Balls to bring Goku back to life, but it turns out Goku must go back across snake way in order to return to Earth. They had run out of time as the Saiyans had just arrived on earth. Piccolo, Gohan, Krilin, Yamcha, and Tien move to hold off the Saiyans so Goku can arrive. The two Saiyans are named Nappa and Prince Vegeta and upon meeting them Piccolo and the others can sense they are extremely powerful. They plant horrible monsters called Cybamen that fight the Z-fighters, Yamcha and Krilin have trouble but Piccolo easily dispatches the Cybamen. Next Nappa steps up and Fights Piccolo overpowering him with little effort. Piccolo dies when Nappa fires a surprise attack at Gohan and he doesn&#39;t dodge so Piccolo takes the attack. Just then Goku arrived and easily brings Nappa to his knees. Seeing Nappa weakness Vegeta killed him to fight Goku himself.

         They take the battle far away so those still alive can recover. During their battle Vegeta explains that their home world, for which he's named, was destroyed while himself, Nappa, and Raditz were off world and they are the last of the Saiyans. The battle was close but Goku came out on top and Vegeta retreated back to Lord Frieza, the strongest being in the universe. With Piccolo dead they no longer had the Dragon Balls in order to bring their friends back to life, but because of the Saiyans they had learned of the planet Namek which Piccolo&#39;s native race, the Namekians, lived and had their own set of Dragon Balls. Bulma, Krilin, and Gohan decided to go to Namek in the ship that King Piccolo had originally came to Earth in while Goku recovered from his fight. Once he healed Goku followed them to Namek in a ship Bulma&#39;s father built.

        Through the Saiyans, Lord Frieza learned of the Namekian Dragon Balls and set toward Namek. By the time Bulma and the others arrived on Namek Fireza had collected several Dragon Balls and was closing in on the rest. They set out immediately to find them and came upon Frieza and his two henchmen Zarbon and Dudoria at a village stealing another Dragon Ball. Gohan and Krilin rescued a youngling from the village but decided to avoid Frieza and his henchmen at all cost sensing their extreme power. Dende, the youngling from the village, bring Gohan and Krilin to the Elder Guru in order to have their hidden potential unlocked. Meanwhile Vegeta had healed grom his battle with Goku and went straight to Namek, landing just after Bulma. Vegeta is set to get the Dragon Balls for himself betraying Frieza. He kills Zarbon and Dudoria causing Frieza to call in the legendary Ginyu Force. Knowing that they have little chance against the Ginyus Vegeta decides to team up with Gohan and Krilin. They are still no match for the Ginyu force and are about to be wiped out when Goku arrived to save the day. Because of Goku&#39;s intense training on his way to Namek the Ginyu were no match for him and he easily defeated them. Finally Goku confronts Frieza and they appear to be equally matched. in order to end the fight Goku attempts a technique called the spirit bomb which appears to work only for Frieza to return soon after.

         Fieza immediately killed Krilin sending Goku into a rage causing him to snap and transform into a Super Saiyan with the power to destroy Frieza.In a move of desperation Frieza destroyed the whole planet hoping to take Goku with him. Everyone escaped in the final moments and were able to return home leaving Goku and Frieza to fight on the dying planet. Goku defeated frieza and escaped with moments to spare but crashed on a strange world and decided to stay and train instead of returning home.

        Once They have settled in back on Earth they sense Frieza&#39; energy coming straight for them. Without Goku the Z-fighters feared the worst and went to confront Frieza. Before they could do anything Frieza and his father, King Cold, were killed by a mysterious person who also claimed to be a Super Saiyan. Sensing Fieza, Goku returned to Earth only to meet this stranger who explained to Goku that his name is Trunks and he is from the future. In the future the earth is in danger from two powerful androids who wiped out the Z-fighters. Hearing this news Goku and everyone decided to train for the impending android attack.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;On the day of the android invasion Goku fell ill with a heart virus and needed several days to recover. Vegeta along with the rest of the Z-fighters and Trunks confront the androids. When he sees them Trunks explains that they are different than the androids of his time, it turns out that they are Dr. Gero, the creator of the androids, and his assistant. With their defeat close Dr. Gero retreats to activate the other two androids. He returned to his lab and powered them on only for them to immediately betray him, over power the Z-fighters, and go on a rampage of their own.

        <img src="Images/DBZ Cell.jpg" alt="Cell absorbing Android 17" class="imgleft" />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;While the Androids search for Goku in order to Kill him another threat emerged. A monster was going from city to city consuming their inhabitants. Piccolo confronted the monster who called himself Cell. Cell explained that he was created by Dr. Gero and was made to absorb the androids and reach his perfect form. Cell fights Piccolo but is outmatched so he blinds him and runs to find the androids. In a move of desperation Piccolo went to Kami, the protector of Earth and his other half. Piccolo and Kami fuse in order to bring Piccolo back to full strength, he set out to find the androids and stop cell from reaching his perfect form.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;Piccolo finds the androids first but finds himself still evenly matched with them. Piccolo had run out f time as cell had arrived sensing the energy of the fight. Cell absorded one of the androids while the other fled in terror. Cell tracked her down absorbing her too.
        <img src="Images/DBZ Cell 2.jpg" alt="Perfect Cell" class="imgright" />
         Vegeta had been training since his defeat at the hands of the androids and went to confront cell. He found himself no match for perfect cell and retreated to Kame house to wait for Goku to regain his strength. Meanwhile Cell, feeling bored and unchallenged by anyone on earth decided to host a Martial Arts Tournament for the fate of the world, giving the Z-fighters one month to prepare. 
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;After the month of training the Z-fighters go to the tournament assuming Goku had become strong enough to defeat Cell. Goku is the first to fight, testing Cells strength against his own. The two seem evenly matched when Goku decides to step down and let Gohan fight. He explains that Gohan has a hidden potential and is the stronger than any of them.
        <img src="Images/DBZ Gohan.jpg" alt="Gohan vs Cell" class="imgleft" />
         Gohan however doen&#39;t share Goku&#39;s love of fighting and is hesitant to fight. He does however and it seems Gohan is no match for Cell. After being pummeled around for a bit and breaking his arm, Cell grew frustrated wanting to see Gohans hidden power. Gohan finally snaps at the death of Android 16 who had been a friend on the side lines. Unleashing his power and rising to a level beyond Super Saiyan Gohan is able to completely over power Cell. Gohan however toys with Cell for too long and he winds up activating his self-destruct in order to destroy the Earth along with him. Goku steps in and uses his Instant Transmission to take himself along with a soon to explode Cell away from Earth to save everyone.
