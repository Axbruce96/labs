    <p>
    Monkey D Luffy was born in a small village on an island in the East Blue, one of the Four Blues or seas. He was raised by his Grandpa Garp, a legendary Marine, who eventually left him in the care of Dadan, a reformed mountain bandit. His childhood friends were his adoptive brothers Portgas D. Ace and Sabo, and the legendary pirate Red Haired Shanks. Shanks was celebrating in the local bar with Luffy and his crew after recovering one of the mysterious Devil Fruit when Luffy ate it while their back was turned. The Devil Fruit turned out to be the Gum-Gum Fruit and it turned Luffy into a Rubber Man. When he turned 16 Luffy set out to become King of the Pirates, a title once held by the most free man in the world, Gol D. Roger. Now he just needs to gather a crew.
