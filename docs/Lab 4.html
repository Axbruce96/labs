    &nbsp;&nbsp;Marc Spector was born in Chicago, Illinois, the son of a Jewish-American Rabbi. As an adult Spector became a heavy weight boxer then a U.S. marine  before finally an elite mercenary and right and man to Raoul Bushman; a man who uses metal teeth and has tattooed his face into a demon to instill fear into friend and foe alike. Spector, never being fond of Bushman&#39;s blood lust, had his frustration boil over while on operation in the Sudan. Bushman learned of Dr. Alruane and his daughter, Marlene Alruane, who had uncovered an ancient Egyptian tomb and a sizable amount of gold. After Bushman ended the life of Dr. Alruane, Spector decided to save the life of Marlene by challenging Bushman; defeated Spector was sent into the desert to die. Upon finding him collapsed in the desert the Egyptians carried him to the feet of the statue Khonshu, the Egyptian god of the moon. Marc Spector arose feeling feeling completely reborn and siting a vision of the spirit he now believes himself to be Khonshu&#39;s earthly avatar. Marc then returned to the states with Marlene; his right hand man and pilot, Jean-Paul DuChamp, or Frenchie for short; and a few alter egos.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;Khonshu is the ancient Egyptian God of the moon, his name translates to traveler. He along with Thoth mark the passage of time, Khonshu was also instrumental in the creation of all life. Worshiped by the ancient Egyptians, he is believed to have brought Marc Spector back to life as his earthly avatar giving him super human strength under the moon. While earlier iterations of Moon Knight eave it vague as to wether Khonshu actually resurrected Spector or that he suffers from delirium after coming so close to death.

Together Jake, Crowley, and Genas sons gather information off the streets for Moon Knight.

    Steven Grant is an up an coming New York millionaire in a long term relationship with Marlene Alruane. Coming into great wealth out of the blue, Steven Grant has quickly swept his way into the arts scene collecting many Ancient Egyptian artifacts.  While the public has no idea where Mr. Grant gained his mass wealth, the truth of the matter is it was stolen by Moon Knight. Shortly after returning from Africa, Marc and Frenchie catch wind of a criminal organization called the &#34;Committee.&#34; Under an elaborate ruse Frenchie gained the Committees trust and convinced them that it was them that created Moon Knight, using this trust Moon Knight stole millions from the Committee and Steven Grant was born. Steven now uses his vast fortune to fund Moon Knights&#39; equipment.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;Moon Knight, the fist of Khonshu, was born into the world when Marc Spector died in the Egyptian Temple of Khonshu. Moon Knight acts as Khonshus avatar for Justice, though when first brought back Marc Spector misinterpreted Moon Knight as a tool for vengeance causing their separation and eventual return. Moon Knight uses the combined resources of Marc Spector, Jake Lockley, and Steven Grant to assist in his adventures. Marc Spector provides battle experience and tactical knowledge, Jake Lockley is his eyes and ears on the street, and Seven Grant is his financier providing his crescent copter, suits, and various other equipment.
