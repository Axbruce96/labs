Congratulations! There were no errors or warnings.

   4: .table1 {

[CSE] Message number 1 in line 4:1:
It's recommended that "*.table1" be used instead of
".table1" so that the universal selector (*) is explicit
instead of implied. Using explicit universal selectors can
decrease confusion and improve readability. This message is
displayed up to 3 times.

[CSE] Message number 3 in line 11:5:
[605] The "border-radius" property is a CSS3 property but
not a CSS1 or CSS 2.1 property. Some browsers (especially
older ones) may not support this property, or may have only
partial support for it, or may require a vendor prefix (like
-moz- or -webkit-). This message is displayed only once.

[73] Section 508 accessibility checking is off.

[CSE] Comment number 3:
[73] WCAG 1.0 accessibility checking is off.

[CSE] Comment number 4:
[73] WCAG 2.0 accessibility checking is off.

[CSE] Comment number 5:
Accessibility checking is off. This program can help you
make your web pages more accessible. An accessible page is
one that more individuals can use, such as individuals who
are blind or deaf. It can also increase the usefulness of
your web page for individuals who browse the web using
slower devices like older computers or wireless devices like
mobile phones and PDAs. An accessible web site makes good
business sense (and possibly good legal sense as well) and
may even improve search engine rankings. You can enable or
disable accessibility checking in the Validator Engine
Options.
